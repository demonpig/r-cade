# Racket Cade (R-cade)

The [R-cade][r-cade] package is a very simple game engine for the [Racket][racket] programming language with a few, specific goals in mind:

* Designed for kids; doing simple things is simple
* No external assets; all rendering, sound, and music is code
* Retro; it's intended to teach some low-level fundamentals
